        "\n",
        "## A Reproducible EEG Processing Framework\n",
        "\n",
        "**SignalFlowEEG (SF)** is a comprehensive and versatile framework designed to streamline the processing of Electroencephalograms (EEG). Utilizing an array of different pipelines, SF aims to ensure reproducibility and consistency across EEG studies.\n",
        "\n",
        "The overarching objective of SF is to generate robust data tables that facilitate summary generation and statistical analysis. These tables can encompass a wide range of EEG features, from intrinsic characteristics to preprocessing steps and sophisticated analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Core Features\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Focus on Data Tables:** \n",
        "    SignalFlowEEG generates tables encapsulating diverse aspects of EEG research, including EEG characteristics, preprocessing procedures, and comprehensive analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **EEGLAB SET Format Compatibility:** \n",
        "    SF employs the universally accepted EEGLAB SET format, providing an efficient data structure for EEG processing and encouraging interoperability with other tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Audit Capabilities:** \n",
        "    To maintain transparency and accountability, SF provides the ability to perform audits on logged actions. This feature allows researchers to trace back and review the sequence of operations applied on the EEG data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **High-Performance File Formats:** \n",
        "    For handling high-dimensional data such as connectivity matrices, SignalFlowEEG adopts high-performance file formats like Apache Parquet. This approach not only ensures data integrity but also facilitates speedy retrieval and efficient storage.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Getting Started: VEP Tutorial (using HAPPE)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Overview\n",
        "In this walkthrough, we will guide you on how to use **SignalFlowEEG** to preprocess and generate ERP (Event-Related Potential) tracings from a VEP (Visual Evoked Potential) dataset using the HAPPE pipeline.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following sections, we will dive deeper into each of these steps:\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Arrange Files for Optimized Processing:** \n",
        "    We'll begin by organizing our files in a way that optimizes SignalFlowEEG's processing capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Preprocess Files Using HAPPE Pipeline:** \n",
        "    Next, we'll utilize the popular HAPPE pipeline to preprocess our VEP dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Output Data Tables:** \n",
        "    After preprocessing, we will output three data tables:\n",
        "    - **EEG Characteristics Table:** This table will present the EEG characteristics of our VEP data, such as original length.\n",
        "    - **Preprocessing Results Table:** This table will showcase the results of our preprocessing steps, including the number of epochs.\n",
        "    - **Amplitude Table for ERPs:** This table will contain the amplitudes necessary to generate ERPs from our VEP dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Modify Preprocessing Step to Observe Effect on ERPs:** \n",
        "    Lastly, we will modify one of our preprocessing steps and examine its impact on the resulting ERPs.\n",

        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "The source code for SignalFlow is hosted on GitHub. There are two primary methods to acquire the code - either through utilizing Git software or directly downloading from the website. However, due to the inclusion of submodules pertaining to other necessary programs, we highly recommend the use of Git for downloading SignalFlow. The direct web download approach requires manual downloading and arrangement of each piece of software within the source code directory, which could prove to be a more time-consuming process.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Method 1: Using Git\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Check if Git is installed:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```bash\n",

        "    Download the install from the official Git website for your operating system at [official Git website](https://git-scm.com).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Create a 'github' directory:**\n",
        "    Choose a location on your drive that will be used to store your toolboxes. \n",
        "\n",
        "   Run use your file explorer or run following command to create a new directory called 'github' and navigate to it:\n",

        "   mkdir github\n",
        "   cd github\n",

        "\n",
        "When working with complex data like EEG datasets, a clear and concise directory structure is essential for efficient data management and processing. A well-organized file structure improves reproducibility and ease of understanding for others (and your future self). \n",
        "\n",
        "Considering the diverse storage requirements of different processes, we suggest splitting up your directories to increase versatility. Our recommendation includes creating three main directories: `data`, `temp`, and `results`. \n",
        "\n",
        "These directories should be nested within a project-specific folder to separate and manage multiple projects effortlessly. We also advise creating a `readme.txt` file in the main folder and  describing the contents and purpose of the project and folders.\n",

        "\n",
        "The *Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)* is a formal way to name and organize neuroimaging data and  metadata in a file system. The goal is to simplify communication and collaboration among users. The format enables easier data validation and software development through consistent paths and naming for data files.\n",
        "\n",
        "SignalFlow does not require the use of BIDS, but it maybe useful for certain projects. You can incorporate the BIDS structure into the project organization strategy described above by placing a BIDS-compliant data folder inside the data directory.\n",
