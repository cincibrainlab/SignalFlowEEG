## Mouse EEG Tutorial {#sec-mouseeg}

In this tutorial, we will guide you on how to use **SignalFlowEEG** analyze EEG tracings from mouse multielectrode array (MEA).

Specifically, we will analzying data from the Neuronexus Mouse EEG v2 H32 probe is a 32-channel EEG MEA specifically designed for mice. Combined with the Omnetics Amplifier Adapter, it provides a complete system for acquiring high-fidelity EEG data from the mouse brain. 

## Overview {#sec-overview}

This tutorial assumes that you have already installed **SignalFlowEEG** (@sec-InstallSignalFlow) and are familiar with the SignalFlow interface (@sec-SetupTab).

During this tutorial we will calculate spectral power and run a connectivity analysis. 

## Loading Data {#sec-loadingdata}

1. Create a new project folder in your filesystem to store the data and analysis results. For example, `~/Documents/mouseEEG`.

2. Create three subfolders in the project folder: 'import', 'temp', and 'results'.

3. On the SignalFlow GUI select the 'Setup' tab and setup your project folders by assigning them to each of the three folders you just created.

4. Let's import our mouse EEG files. In this example, we will be assuming you have already preprocessed the data into SET format. We will use the import tool to copy over the SET files to our project folder.

Select "Open the VHTP Import Tool"  button underneath the Setup Project Folders pane:

5. The vHTP import tool is a multipurpose utility to import data from a variety of formats into EEGLAB SET format. It also can copy SET files directly. The Import tool has the ability to select SET files across subfolders and perform keyword filtering which has advantages compared to a manual file copy.

Please refer to the vHTP import tool documentation and follow the instructions for copy SET files to your project folder (*Example Workflow 2*).

Here is example of the import tool with the SET files selected and the destination folder set to the 'import' folder in your project folder:

After you have selected the SET files and the destination folder, click the 'Import to SET' button to copy the files over. You will notice in the terminal window that each file will be loaded into EEGLAB and a channel montage graphic will be exported to confirm channel locations.

Details regarding the import will be in the command window:

Following the import, you should see the SET files in the 'import' folder:

6. Return to the SignalFlow Application and fill in any Project Details you would like to include. These details will be included in the analysis report.

7. Next move to the Builder tab to start our analysis workflow. 

    From the inflow modules select "Import SET"
    From the outflow modules select "Calculate Rest Power"

8. Confirm the module outflow path where the power results will be saved. In this example, we will save the results to the 'results' folder in our project folder.

9. Switch to the Execute Tab and click the "Execute (Loop)" Button to import each SET file sequentially and calculate the power. The results will be stored in table format in the 'results' folder.

## Optional: Customize Power Bands {#sec-customizebands}

Published mouse EEG bands differ in exact frequencies from human EEG bands. You can customize the power bands by making a copy of the 'Calculate Rest Power' module and editing the 'Power Bands' parameter.

1. To start, go back to the setup tab. In your file system, create a new results folder called "results_custombands" to distinguish it from your other results folder. 

2. Next, in the Setup tab select "Add Custom Folder" and select the "results_custombands" folder you just created. Add a easy to remember tag so you can identify it later.

3. Switch to the Builder tab. Click on "Calculate Rest Power" and press the "Delete Module" Button. This will remove the default power module.

4. Find "Calculate Rest Power" in the outflow modules and click on "Copy and Edit Module". This will create a copy of the power module that you can edit.

5. The MATLAB editor will open up with a copy of the power module. Here the parameters can be clearly seen, including the power band definitions.

6. Let's edit the power band definitions based on Jonak et al. 2020:
"Power was then further binned into standard frequency bands: Delta (1–4 Hz), Theta (4–10 Hz), Alpha (10–13 Hz), Beta (13–30 Hz), and Gamma was divided into “Low Gamma” (30–55 Hz), and “High Gamma” (65–100 Hz)."
