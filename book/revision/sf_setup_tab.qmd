# SignalFlow: Setup Tab {#sec-SetupTab}

The setup tab is the starting page for every user. It allows the user to configure their workstation and pipeline. This includes adding the correct paths to toolboxes and also adding folder locations for data.

In SignalFlow, assigned folders are given tags. These tags are used to reference the folder locations in the pipeline. This allows the user to change the folder location without having to hardcode a foldername into their code. This is useful when sharing code with other users.
