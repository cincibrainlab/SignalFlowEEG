![](../assets/images/ExecuteTab.png)
*  The execute tab is used to execute the pipeline on EEG files. Users also have buttons that serve as helpful tools.

## Refresh
* This button is used to refresh the workflow status and file catalog when a change to the file sytem or pipeline has occured.
    A.  An example of this would be adding a file to the import directory. The user must click the "Refresh" button in order to see it in the File Catalog.

## Execute (Loop)
* This button is used to execute the pipeline on all eeg files in the import directory. These will be done one at a time. 
* Use this if there are steps that require user input.
    A. Examples of this include: Remove channels, remove epochs, etc.

## Execute (Parallel)
* This button is used to execute the pipeline on all eeg files in the import directory. These will be done all at the same time. 
* This should only be used when the follwoing are true.
    A. Use this if there are no steps that require user input. Examples of this include: Remove channels, remove epochs, etc. 
    B. You have a high performance computer.
    C. The pipeline takes longer than 1 minutes to run on a single eeg file. The setup and tear down of workers may take some time. inefficient use could make the processing time longer.
    D. You have the Matlab Parralel Processing Toolbox
