# Visual Evoked Potentials (VEP) Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will guide you on how to use **SignalFlowEEG** to preprocess and generate ERP (Event-Related Potential) tracings from a VEP (Visual Evoked Potential) dataset using the HAPPE pipeline.

## Overview
In this walkthrough, we will guide you on how to use **SignalFlowEEG** to preprocess and generate ERP (Event-Related Potential) tracings from a VEP (Visual Evoked Potential) dataset using the HAPPE pipeline.

In the following sections, we will dive deeper into each of these steps:

1. **Setting up SignalFlowEEG and its Dependencies:** 
    Learn how to install and configure SignalFlowEEG and its dependencies.

1. **Arrange Files for Optimized Processing:** 
    We'll begin by organizing our files in a way that optimizes SignalFlowEEG's processing capabilities.

1. **Preprocess Files Using HAPPE Pipeline:** 
    Next, we'll utilize the popular HAPPE pipeline to preprocess our VEP dataset.

1. **Output Data Tables:** 
    After preprocessing, we will output three data tables:
    - **EEG Characteristics Table:** This table will present the EEG characteristics of our VEP data, such as original length.
    - **Preprocessing Results Table:** This table will showcase the results of our preprocessing steps, including the number of epochs.
    - **Amplitude Table for ERPs:** This table will contain the amplitudes necessary to generate ERPs from our VEP dataset.

1. **Modify Preprocessing Step to Observe Effect on ERPs:** 
    Lastly, we will modify one of our preprocessing steps and examine its impact on the resulting ERPs.

Let's get started!
