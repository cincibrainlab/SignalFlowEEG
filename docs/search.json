    "text": "Welcome\nSignalFlowEEG (SF) is a comprehensive and versatile framework designed to streamline the processing of Electroencephalograms (EEG). Utilizing an array of different pipelines, SF aims to ensure reproducibility and consistency across EEG studies.\nThe overarching objective of SF is to generate robust data tables that facilitate summary generation and statistical analysis. These tables can encompass a wide range of EEG features, from intrinsic characteristics to preprocessing steps and sophisticated analysis."

This feature allows researchers to trace back and review the sequence of operations applied on the EEG data.\nHigh-Performance File Formats: For handling high-dimensional data such as connectivity matrices, SignalFlowEEG adopts high-performance file formats like Apache Parquet. This approach not only ensures data integrity but also facilitates speedy retrieval and efficient storage."

Signalflow can handle EEG data from human recordings but also from other signal sources such as ?sec-mouse-eeg.\nThis flexibility should allow you to chose the best toolkit for a specific task, while still providing uniform outputs that can be analyzed similarly."

The direct web download approach requires manual downloading and arrangement of each piece of software within the source code directory, which could prove to be a more time-consuming process."

A well-organized file structure improves reproducibility and ease of understanding for others (and your future self).\nConsidering the diverse storage requirements of different processes, we suggest splitting up your directories to increase versatility. Our recommendation includes creating three main directories: data, temp, and results.\nThese directories should be nested within a project-specific folder to separate and manage multiple projects effortlessly. We also advise creating a readme.txt file in the main folder and describing the contents and purpose of the project and folders.\nHere’s a simple, recommended structure:\n\nProjectName/\n\nreadme.txt\ndata/\ntemp/\nresults/\n\n\nThe data directory should contain all the raw data that will be processed. The temp directory will store any temporary files created during data processing, and the results directory will hold the output from your analyses."

    "text": "2.2 Using the BIDS format\nThe Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) is a formal way to name and organize neuroimaging data and metadata in a file system. The goal is to simplify communication and collaboration among users. The format enables easier data validation and software development through consistent paths and naming for data files.\nSignalFlow does not require the use of BIDS, but it maybe useful for certain projects. You can incorporate the BIDS structure into the project organization strategy described above by placing a BIDS-compliant data folder inside the data directory.\n- ProjectName/\n  - readme.txt\n  - data/\n    - BIDS/\n      - sub-01/\n        - ses-01/\n          - eeg/\n            - sub-01_ses-01_task-mytask_eeg.edf\n            - sub-01_ses-01_task-mytask_channels.tsv\n            - sub-01_ses-01_task-mytask_electrodes.tsv\n            - sub-01_ses-01_task-mytask_events.tsv\n            - ...\n      - ...\n  - temp/\n  - results/\nSignalFlow relies on helper functions from the Cincinnati Visual High Throughput Pipeline (vHTP). The standard file list utility (util_htpDirListing.m) can create a custom file list from a BIDS directory structure.\nRemember, a well-planned and maintained directory structure can save time and prevent confusion as your project grows."

This might vary depending on where you cloned the repository. The paths are generally as follows:\n\nFor Windows: C:\\\\Users\\\\**YourUsername**\\\\Documents\\\\github\\\\SignalFlow_HBCD\nFor Linux or macOS: /home/**YourUsername**/Documents/github/SignalFlow_HBCD\n\nReplace **YourUsername** with your actual username on your computer.\nTo navigate to this directory in MATLAB, you can use the cd (change directory) command in MATLAB’s Command Window:\ncd('path-to-directory')\nReplace 'path-to-directory' with the appropriate path above.\nFind the SignalFlow application file.\nIn MATLAB’s Current Folder pane (typically located on the left side of the interface), scroll to locate the SignalFlow application file named “SignalFlowEEG.mlapp”.\nRun the SignalFlow application. \nRight-click on the “SignalFlowEEG.mlapp” file and select “Run” from the context menu.\nCheck SignalFlow Application.\n\nThe SignalFlow Application should now open. If the GUI does not open or you encounter an error, ensure that you have the correct directory and the “SignalFlowEEG.mlapp” file is present.\nCheck dependencies\n\nIf you check the command window, you will see that SignalFlow will do a careful check for any missing dependencies. If you encounter any errors, revist the Chapter 1 section to ensure that you have installed all the necessary dependencies.\nThe command SignalFlowDoctor will do a careful check for missing toolkits and also have options for repair. Restart SignalFlow after installing any missing dependencies.\n\n\n\nSignalFlowDoctor\n\n\nIn this case, SignalFlowDoctor identifies two issues as missing EEGLAB toolkits. Running the recommended commands in the command window will install the missing toolkits. If a plugin cannot be installed automatically, you may need to open EEGLAB and install it though the plugin manager.\nWith these steps, you should be able to successfully launch the SignalFlow EEG Application in MATLAB."
