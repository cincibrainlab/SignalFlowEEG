There are two primary methods to acquire the code - either through utilizing Git software or directly downloading from the website. However, due to the inclusion of submodules pertaining to other necessary programs, we highly recommend the use of Git for downloading SignalFlow. The direct web download approach requires manual downloading and arrangement of each piece of software within the source code directory, which could prove to be a more time-consuming process.\n\n4.1.1 Method 1: Using Git\n\nCheck if Git is installed:\nOpen a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:\ngit --version\nIf Git is installed, you will see the version number. If not, proceed to the next step.\nInstall Git:\nDownload the install from the official Git website for your operating system at official Git website.\nCreate a ‘github’ directory: Choose a location on your drive that will be used to store your toolboxes.\nRun use your file explorer or run following command to create a new directory called ‘github’ and navigate to it:\nmkdir github\ncd github\nClone the SignalFlow repository with submodules:\nRun the following command to clone the repository and its submodules:\ngit clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/cincibrainlab/SignalFlowEEG_HBCD.git\nThis will clone the repository and its submodules into the ‘github’ directory. The output will be displayed in the terminal or command prompt.\nClone other necessary toolkits: In addition to SignalFlowEEG, you may need to clone several other toolkits. Here are the necessary commands:\n\n\nEEGLAB:\ngit clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/sccn/eeglab.git\nBrainstorm:\ngit clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/brainstorm-tools/brainstorm3.git\nHAPPE Pipeline:\ngit clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/PINE-Lab/HAPPE.git\nMADE Pipeline:\ngit clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ChildDevLab/MADE-EEG-preprocessing-pipeline.git\nAfter cloning these repositories, you’ll have all the necessary toolkits for your EEG data analysis. Make sure to keep these repositories up-to-date by pulling the latest changes regularly by using the command:\ngit pull --recurse-submodules"

This can be done from the main page of each repository on GitHub. Note that this method will require additional steps to organize the downloaded content.\nHere are the steps to download and organize the repositories:\n\nNavigate to each repository’s GitHub page in your web browser.\nClick on the Code button and then click Download ZIP.\nOnce the download is complete, extract the ZIP file.\nCreate a new folder in your github directory for each extracted repository. The name of the folder should match the repository name.\n\nHere are the links to each repository: - SignalFlow: https://github.com/cincibrainlab/SignalFlowEEG_HBCD.git - VHTP: https://github.com/cincibrainlab/vhtp - VHTP Dependencies: https://github.com/cincibrainlab/vhtp_dependencies - HAPPE Pipeline: https://github.com/PINE-Lab/HAPPE - MADE Pipeline: https://github.com/ChildDevLab/MADE-EEG-preprocessing-pipeline\nNote: For the VHTP and VHTP Dependencies, make sure to place these folders in the SignalFlowEEG_HBCD folder, as they are necessary for certain SignalFlow operations.\nEEGLAB and Brainstorm must be downloaded through their respective non-github websites. This is because any submodules cannot be downloaded through the github website without git.\n\nEEGLAB: https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/index.php\nBrainstorm:https://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/Introduction\n\nAfter extraction, you will have the complete repository with all its files and folders available on your computer."

A well-organized file structure improves reproducibility and ease of understanding for others (and your future self).\nConsidering the diverse storage requirements of different processes, we suggest splitting up your directories to increase versatility. Our recommendation includes creating three main directories: data, temp, and results.\nThese directories should be nested within a project-specific folder to separate and manage multiple projects effortlessly. We also advise creating a readme.txt file in the main folder and describing the contents and purpose of the project and folders.\nHere’s a simple, recommended structure:\n\nProjectName/\n\nreadme.txt\ndata/\ntemp/\nresults/\n\n\nThe data directory should contain all the raw data that will be processed. The temp directory will store any temporary files created during data processing, and the results directory will hold the output from your analyses."

    "text": "5.2 Using the BIDS format\nThe Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) is a formal way to name and organize neuroimaging data and metadata in a file system. The goal is to simplify communication and collaboration among users. The format enables easier data validation and software development through consistent paths and naming for data files.\nSignalFlow does not require the use of BIDS, but it maybe useful for certain projects. You can incorporate the BIDS structure into the project organization strategy described above by placing a BIDS-compliant data folder inside the data directory.\n- ProjectName/\n  - readme.txt\n  - data/\n    - BIDS/\n      - sub-01/\n        - ses-01/\n          - eeg/\n            - sub-01_ses-01_task-mytask_eeg.edf\n            - sub-01_ses-01_task-mytask_channels.tsv\n            - sub-01_ses-01_task-mytask_electrodes.tsv\n            - sub-01_ses-01_task-mytask_events.tsv\n            - ...\n      - ...\n  - temp/\n  - results/\nSignalFlow relies on helper functions from the Cincinnati Visual High Throughput Pipeline (vHTP). The standard file list utility (util_htpDirListing.m) can create a custom file list from a BIDS directory structure.\nRemember, a well-planned and maintained directory structure can save time and prevent confusion as your project grows."
