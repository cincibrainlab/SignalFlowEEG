We will review in the following order.
1. module superclass 
- Discuss limitations of the module superclass
- Discuss the module superclass in the context of the module pattern
- review code style and best practices
2. SIgnalFlowControl
3. SignalFlowGuiClass

ALl changes are marked in file with "TODO"

WHen we change from handlers, we need to make sure those functions are usefull too

Make the filter a text box, make the name and the flowmode searchable  (Praveens Idea ), color code them too

Validttiom for there bing an import on pipeline run (Praveen said he did this for auto) but we need to check for everythign else

For inflow and midflow just completely hide output folder tag selct and button

Maybe just make module information show the info and have the dropdown only for ouflow modules

Review edit module and copy edit module, these don't really have a use case and are confusing. 
If someone wants to edit a module, they can just copy it and then edit it.

If no module selected in pipeline, reordering just throws a ton of errors.

We should make a permanent loading bar on the gui to show the progress of the pipeline run.

We need to add error handling everywhere. 

We should maybe remmake gui using grid layout, it would be easier to manage and look better.
